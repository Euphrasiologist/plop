This is a port of
[silentbicycle/guff](https://github.com/silentbicycle/guff) to Rust.
Much of the credit goes to the original author, Scott Vokes.

This port has various extensions and adaptations. Perhaps
unsurprisingly, among the TODOs for this project is to expand the
README.

The initial implementation was done [as a
livestream](https://youtube.com/live/MAwYsKYYXs0?feature=share).
